Hello everyone, I am Xianpu Ji from China, currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree at Hohai University with a focus on tropical atmospheric dynamics. In my academic journey, I am not only dedicated to exploring fundamental theories but also applying my knowledge to address practical meteorological challenges.

In my daily life, I enjoy a variety of activities. Playing badminton is one of my ways to relax, while playing mahjong and running contribute to keeping me physically active and energetic.

My skills include proficiency in the Python programming language, utilizing WRF numerical simulations for meteorological modeling, and a understanding of some basic diagnostic methods. Additionally, I have conducted research in the field of short-term forecasting of heavy rainfall based on deep learning. This aspect of my research expands my expertise into the forefront of modern meteorological forecasting technology.

I warmly welcome friends who are interested in my research areas to engage in discussions and learning together.
